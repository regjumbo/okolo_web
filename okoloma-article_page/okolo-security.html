            Security of the Niger Delta People(Bonny and its Neighboring Communities in Particular)
        </h1>
        <p class="head-explain">
            Since 2005 the security situation in the Niger Delta has deteriorated.  Heavily armed and well-organized gangs steal large volumes of crude oil worth millions of dollars a year and invade oil and gas facilities in the delta, shutting down operations, kidnapping staff and sabotaging equipment including pipelines. (Shell Nigeria)

        <p class="para-text">
            Security has always appeared to be a huge challenge ever since the dawn of the establishment of the state and country at large. 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            Whether it is ethnic, foreign, economic, social or political, security has always been a huge debate since we realized that Prime Ministers, Heads of States, Premiers, and Traditional rulers, in many cases even security personnel, could be lynched as though they were nobody.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            One of the major aspects of the All Progressive Congressâ€™ (APC) administration during its early days of campaign in 2014 was Security, because they realized as well as many other Nigerians that Security threat has always been a problem.

                 Security Threat
            </p>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">
            Whether it is a Bullion van going to deliver money at the bank that gets hijacked, or a political campaign turn violent, or a school pupil or an expatriate being kidnapped-- whatever it is, in a society where there are more hungry mouths than pot bellies, there are bound to be such incidences which is why multi-billion organizations such as Total, Shell, NNPC go extra mile to protect their investment (NLNG). 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text imp">
            No one is to say what is too small or what is too big to do for the people of Bonny, the host community of the fourth largest oil Petroleum Company in the world.  
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            As such, all should do everything possible within its power to see that their host community is well of, after all, charity they say begins at home. 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            The demands of the people are few yet they are neglected. One of such demand is the security of our waterways for safe passage since the Federal road has not materialized due to Pirate activities on the Bonny seas. 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            Bonny is the only global village where one has to sit on a boat for almost two (2) hours to access except for those few exalted ones who have the grace of going through the NLNG booking where Security escort follows them to their destination at Port Harcourt base jetty or through a first class chopper aircraft, so then what happens to the rest of us??? 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            Similarly, what happens to those of our brothers and sisters and children yet unborn whose future have been mortgaged by our heroes past and present in a bid to secure their fat purses?? What about those that did not go into the mangrove, those who were not able to fight, what are their compensation? 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            Until we answer these questions, we are creating more problems for ourselves by not getting to the root cause of the matter and instead trying to silence us with money that is naturally ours.
