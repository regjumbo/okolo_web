            Environmental Degradation: What is Our Fate?
        </h1>
        <p class="head-explain">
            Environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change of the United Nations.The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines environmental degradation as "the reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs"("ISDR : Terminology". The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. 2004-03-31. Retrieved 2010-06-09).

                Environmental Degradation as a result of Oil Spillage and Gas Flaring
            </p>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">
            The Niger Delta is home to the wealth that has made Nigeria the largest producer of Petroleum in Africa and the sixth largest in the world (Watts, 2004).

        <h2 class="sub-head">
            Oil Spillage
        </h2>
        <p class="para-text">
            In the Niger Delta, oil spill is a common occurrence and has been linked to corrosion of pipelines, poor maintenance of infrastructures, spills or leaks during processing at refineries, human errors and intentional acts of vandalism or oil theft (Amnesty International, 2009).
        </p>

            </p>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">
            The United Nations Development Program (2006) estimates that between 1976 to 2001 there has been approximately 6,800 spills totaling 3,000,000 barrels of oil. 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            According to the data from the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC, 2004), around 324,000 barrels in about 1500 incidences spilled from its facilities between 2007 and 2013.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            Shell reports that of the total oil spill from SPDC facilities in 2003, about 75% is due to sabotage/theft, while 15% is due to operation spills resulting from corrosion, equipment failure, human error, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            However, Amnesty International has challenged Shell, accusing the company of misrepresenting oil spill data and misinforming the public.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            From the above data, it could be confidently argued that the environmental hazard caused by the multiplicity of international petroleum firms carrying out their various activities on our soil has a severe long term adverse effect on the community in terms of potential health challenges that are bound to arise as a result of the pollution cause on the environment by the activities of these multi-nationals.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            The resulting health risks are impossibly terrifying from data shown by both foreign and local organizations. 
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            The wild life (fauna) of our communities are gradually going into extinction, and caution is not taken, maybe it is possible to believe that the might be time when our seas would be devoid of aquatic lives due to these constant pollution of both our waterways and our entire environment.

            Bonny is a very small town and should not be so difficult to manage yet we are faced with many setbacks.

        <h2 class="sub-head">
            Gas Flaring
        </h2>
        <p class="para-text">
            There were times in this town when we fished from our water and also drank rain water. But today, all that has fast ran out of fashion as the situation is so bad that one cannot use rain water to wash clothes or plates neither can you forget your clothes outside for it to get wet by rain as it will cause permanent chemical stains due to the intense nature of these various biohazard that pose major health threat to the un-sensitized,un-educated old woman or man in our various communities who do not share in the knowledge of multi-billion dollar experiences of the few privileged multi-nationals and their entire organizations.
        </p>
        <figure class="show-fig">

                 Gas Flaring
            </p>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">
            Over the years, we over here at the Niger Delta have witnessed fundamental changes in our atmosphere in relation to the recent gas flaring which is constantly eating through our weather, causing "Erosion", "Black Soothe", "Corrosion" and all forms of Environmental Degradation.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            For instance, a new air-condition system cannot last a year without turning rust, Whites turn to Blacks if left under the rain and the health problems that follow is almost unthinkable. The life span of the average indigene has drastically dropped to a staggering proportion.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            According to the General Manager External Relations, "Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) was set up to reduce gas flaring in Nigeria. And we have been able to reduce that from 60-70% to less than 20%. Hopefully, with Train 7 we will take more gas and reduce gas flaring to 0%"---this statement made by the General Manager in its entirety is far fetched from the truth and obvious. Evidently, it is possible that one may deduce that they are being economical with the facts.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
            Amazingly, a lot could still be done to salvage the situation that gradually is gaining mass appeal because it concerns us all.
